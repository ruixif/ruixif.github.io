My name is Ruixi Fan, currently working at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en). 

Before Google, I worked at [Typeface](https://www.typeface.ai/), an AI startup company, building intelligent systems for complexed commercial ads image content. 

Before joining Typeface, I worked at [Treat Technologies](https://www.trytreat.io/), focusing on creating performant advertisement content through large, generative AI system. Treat's main technical assets were acquired by Typeface in 2024, and I joined Typeface through the acquisition. 

Before joining Treat, I worked as an engineer at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), working on system engineering for machine learning applications, including model training and inference pipeline, streaming data processing and experimentation platform.  

Prior to stepping into the industry, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying spectroscopy's application and
quantum-chemistry modeling on (*bio*)-metallocatalysis. My publication list can be found at
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m5guE0AAAAJ). 

I have a long-term interest in heterogeous 
catalysis and advanced materials with d/f-block metals. I am building a proof of concept on leveraging large language 
model to discover functional materials (e.g. room-temperature super-conductor under ambient pressure). 

I am also an amateur video-game player focusing on action games appear to be difficult but have discoverable smooth learning curves, 
such as [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/content/atvi/sekiro/web/en/home.html), [Cuphead](http://www.cupheadgame.com/),
