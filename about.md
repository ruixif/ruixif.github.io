My name is Ruixi Fan, currently working as a machine-learning engineer at [Treat Technologies](https://www.trytreat.io/), 
focusing on creating performant advertisement content through large, generative AI system. Previously, I worked as an 
engineer at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), focusing on system engineering for machine learning applications, including 
model training and inference pipeline, streaming data processing and experimentation platform.  

Prior to this job, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying spectroscopy's application and
quantum-chemistry modeling on (*bio*)-metallocatalysis. My publication list can be found at
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m5guE0AAAAJ). I have a long-term interest in heterogeous 
catalysis and advanced materials with d/f-block metals. I am building a proof of concept on leveraging large language 
model to discover functional materials (e.g. room-temperature super-conductor under ambient pressure). 

I am also an amateur video-game player focusing on action games appear to be difficult but have discoverable smooth learning curves, 
such as [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/content/atvi/sekiro/web/en/home.html), [Cuphead](http://www.cupheadgame.com/),
[Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls), [Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight).
