title: System Design Problem: 
---

Imagine you are the CEO of a 20K-employee company and you want your employees to be back to offices (BTO) at least 4 
day a week. Please design a system to find out what employees have not reached this BTO threshold; and send a friendly
email to remind them of coming back if one does not meet the standard.
