### About me

Welcome to my home page!

My name is Ruixi Fan, currently working as an engineer at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), focusing on Machine Learning 
System that involves model training and inference pipeline, streaming data processing and experimentation of algorithms. 

Prior to this job, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying spectroscopy's application and
quantum-chemistry modeling on (*bio*)-metallocatalysis. You can view my publication list on 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4m5guE0AAAAJ).

I am also an amateur video-game player focusing on action games appear to be difficult but have discoverable smooth learning curves, 
such as [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/content/atvi/sekiro/web/en/home.html), [Cuphead](http://www.cupheadgame.com/),
